/-- The common charged tail of the absorbed case-(ii) family.  Its input is
the literal `[177]` ledger, possibly already carrying `[176]`'s closure for the
case-(i) subfamily.  Every Type-B alternative is consumed at its registered
owner and then converted by the common `[76]`/`[85]` quantitative tail.  Thus a
mixed absorbed family never discards the facts appended before this call. -/
