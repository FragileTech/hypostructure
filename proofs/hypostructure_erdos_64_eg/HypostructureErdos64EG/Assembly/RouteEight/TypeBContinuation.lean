/-- **The unified target-defect/route-`8` ledger with the Type B bridge
allowance** (`rem:why-unified`, `prop:typeB-bridge-sublinear`).

The Type B bridge mass and its sublinear reading are published, then
`def:typeA-unified-negative`, the Type A exclusion and Type B bridge reduction,
`thm:branch-kill`'s piece classification, and the extracted route-`8` core
census; the branch then continues through the unified residual
(`selectedRouteEightUnifiedResidual`).  Every caller that reaches this ledger
-- the negative arm of node `[113]` and the Type B certificate lanes -- runs
this one composition on its own literal residual. -/
