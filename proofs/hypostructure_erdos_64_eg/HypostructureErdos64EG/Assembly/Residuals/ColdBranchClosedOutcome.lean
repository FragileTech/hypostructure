# Assembly: the `ColdBranchClosedOutcome` residual, split by fact set

`ColdBranchClosedOutcome` ([187], local cold-terminal exclusion) is reached
at G along the [153] linear cold-mass arm of the realized package with a
silent germ family (the singleton `linearRealizedSilent`), and along `[153]`'s
repeat on the two dense linear arms (the subtypes `..._repeated`, G audit
`[153]`).
The 100 paths through the absorbed-germ residual `[174]`--`[177]` (formerly
the product `ColdBranchClosedOutcome_product`) are not entered: `[173]`'s
no-arm is closed at the node against the private-carrier rate `K .route8Rate`
(`instIncompatibleExactCollisionFailsRoute8Rate`).

The singleton lists every key of its arm as an explicit `Holds` conjunct, and
its return theorem reads each fact with one `ExactLedger.get`.

G repair (R4): the three former singletons `linearDenseAtOrAbove`,
`linearDenseRateFailed` and `linearRealizedDistinguished` carried the `[154]`
G2 yes-arm `K .coldGermSomeDistinguishing`.  Read at G that arm is empty (the
two representatives of every germ have the same target response in `G − Z`),
and it is closed at `[154]` against the selection
(`instIncompatibleColdGermSomeDistinguishingSelection`).  They are unreachable
at G and are removed, together with their place in the root result type.

G audit (`[153]`): the equal-state pair of `[153]` is the (F5) repeat subcase and
continues into the germ path.  `K .coldCutStatesDistinct` is no longer a fact of
the generic residual; the two dense-arm subtypes `..._repeated` carry
`K .coldRepeatedStateResidual` instead (the dense ¬(★) arm of `[153]`).

/-- **`[187]` (local cold-terminal exclusion), singleton `linearRealizedSilent`**
(94 facts): [153] linear cold mass in `nearCubicRealized`: [158] realized, [146] theta at or above, [154] none realizing / none distinguishing; [157]/[163] G's silent family has a neutral equal-length configuration (`coldAbsorbedNeutralConfiguration`) whose genuine second strand is closed at [167]--[168], so the canonical-replacement arm holds (`coldCanonicalNeutralConfiguration`), and [165]--[166] force `Q = E` (`coldCanonicalReplacementSwap`, `coldCanonicalReplacementTrivial`); [157] the marked germ is not handed off and its replacement is not strictly smaller (`coldMarkedGermUncompressed`); [157] F08: the excision of any path spanning the marked germ's support misses the baseline or leaves a non-accepted cycle length `L + q` in G (`coldMarkedGermStretchExcision`); [169] `blockedClassMember` is a fact of G here too but is not carried (see `blockedCompressionCap_iff_windowPackageRealized`). -/

/-! ## The `[153]` repeat routed into the germ path (G audit)

`lem:cold-corridor-first-failure` continues an (F5) repeat into the germ routing
(`[154]`, G1/G2/G3); the returned equal-state residual of `[153]` stopped there.
At G a repeat is the first failure of a retained corridor with no earlier event,
so it is a germ of the extracted family, and the rows of `[154]`--`[157]` read
neither `K .coldCutStatesDistinct` nor its absence.  On the dense linear arms
of `[160]` the (★) decision is still taken (`[162]` reads it); its ¬(★) arm now
runs the germ path to `[157]` and returns `[187]` with the constructed
equal-state pair `K .coldRepeatedStateResidual` as one more fact of the same
ledger.  These are the two `[187]` subtypes of that route. -/
