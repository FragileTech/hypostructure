# Assembly: Residuals / Route8RateFailsOutcome

Node `[187]` (private-carrier rate failure), split by the distinct fact set of
the single ledger at its return.  The generic `Route8RateFailsOutcome`
(`Assembly/Residuals.lean`) carries the 66 facts common to every path; the
eleven paths reach it through `[158]`/`[160]` (three upstream arms) times the
four surviving arms of `[50]`--`[55]`, less the high-entropy arm after the
failed dense rate (closed at `[53]`: on the dense residual with `τ(θ) < 1/4`
the package overflows the skeleton budget, so the entropy cap is active), and
each path's ledger holds a distinct set of extra facts.  Each subtype is the generic residual together with every
extra fact of its path, one `Holds` conjunct per key.
