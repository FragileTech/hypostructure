/-! ## Node `[24]`: `prop:p13-density`, after the cold branch closes

The manuscript's `[24]` reads "bounded cold-mass return from [153]:
`θ ≤ θ_win + o(1)`; high entropy: `θ ≤ 0.01198542083…`".  The finite density cap `K .densityCap` is
produced after the cold branch has closed on the literal residual.  Its
consumers require that exact ledger fact. -/

/-! ## Nodes `[25]`--`[27]`: the packed-window remainder

`sec:remainder`.  With `W` the union of a maximal packing and `R = G − W`, the
manuscript asserts that `R` carries no induced window -- "since any such copy
would extend `𝒫`" -- and that no subgraph of `R` has minimum degree at least the
baseline.  The second is the cited external law applied at its own interface:
the induced closure of such a subgraph is still window-free, so it has an
accepted cycle, and a cycle of an induced subgraph is a cycle of the selected
object, which avoids the target.

The row quantifies over every maximal packing rather than naming one.  That is
what the manuscript's statement actually says, and it is also what the ledger
permits: a packing is data, and no fact can carry it.  The row's manifest
therefore lists `selection` alone -- the avoidance half of it is the only thing
the derivation consumes. -/
